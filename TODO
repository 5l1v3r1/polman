# Version 0.3
x* add default output file or dir for when writing sensor rules
x* check if sensor needs updates against ruledb updated
x* Output in status how many active rules for a sensor.
x* write active rules for a sensor to "its original" filenames
x* enable all default enabled rules in ruledb
   (should then be easy to disable all policy.rules etc.)
x* When RuleDB is updated, there should be a way to say
   that all new rules that are default enabled, should be
   default turned ON or not. (add it sensor menu)
   [*] Apply "new default enbaled rules" to ruleset
x* FlowBit tracking and automagically enable if needed
x* Through stuff out in .pm's
x* Add modified time to all rules (rev nr changes)
   - So one can easy see what rules changes when....
x* Generate sid-msg.map for sensor rules (or ruledb?)


# 0.4
 * If not exists, mkdir /var/lib/polman/
 * We might do a cmdline "search" so we can look for new rules
   in ruledb, and process them in a batch or rule by rule...
 * download rules from web (also via proxys) 

# X.X
 * Enhance the backend
 * Optimize, fast and as low as possible on memmory usage.
-* Saved searches for Enable/Disable rules. That are performed
   when updating sensor<->ruledb ?
 * ncurses frontend
 * ip/tcp server for communicating with the backend.
